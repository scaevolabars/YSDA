The identity matrix commutes with all matrices.
Every diagonal matrix commutes with all other diagonal matrices.[4]
Jordan blocks commute with upper triangular matrices that have the same value along bands.
If the product of two symmetric matrices is symmetric, then they must commute.
Circulant matrices commute. They form a commutative ring since the sum of two circulant matrices is circulant.
